This research proposal delves into the distinctive musical signature of the renowned band T-Square, known for their fusion of jazz, funk, and contemporary instrumental music. Our primary goal is to thoroughly examine and analyze the musical attributes of the band T-Square from multiple angles. Additionally, we aspire to produce music that closely resembles the style of T-Square.
By exploring these intricate patterns, this study not only enriches our understanding of T-Square's musical magic but also opens avenues for musicians and researchers to create music inspired by specific artists, emphasizing the fusion of music theory and computational techniques.

Objectives and Methodology:
✅Data Collection
✅Music Dataset: Acquire a comprehensive dataset of T-Square's music. This could include studio albums, live performances, and collaborations.
✅Metadata: Collect metadata for each track, such as release date, album, duration, and any other relevant information.
✅Feature Extraction & Analysis
✅Audio Features: Extract audio features like tempo, pitch, timbre, harmony, and rhythm using tools like Librosa.
Stylistic Characteristics: Identify unique stylistic elements that define T-Square's music, such as specific instruments, chord progressions, or motifs.
Music Generation
We’ll select appropriate machine learning models, use the extracted features and T-Square's music dataset to train the model. Once the model is trained, generate music and evaluate how closely it resembles T-Square's style. This could be done subjectively (listening sessions) or objectively (comparing generated features with original features).
